== Introduction

FitHelper (FH) is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing contacts*. More importantly, FH is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, AB3 can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

FitHelper mainly serves as a fitness log book where users can *mark down their diet and exercises entries* and *be reminded about their plans*. They can also *visualize their performance* to be encouraged.


== Quick Start

.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Fitness Helper.

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add en/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add en/running`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `en/NAME [r/REMARK]` can be used as `en/swimming r/energy consuming but fun` or as `en/running`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[r/remark]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `r/really fun`, `r/really fun r/helps me lose weight` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `en/NAME et/Wednesday 6 pm`, `et/Wednesday 6 pm en/NAME` is also acceptable.
* `X` in this document refers to f/s, representing two types of entries: food and sports. e.g. `addX` represents either `addf` or `adds`; `add[X]` means the field `X` is optional.
* The field `TIME` should be entered in the fixed format of `yyyy-mm-dd[-hh-mm]` where the `hours` and `minutes` can be omitted.
* The field `DATE` should be entered in the fixed format of `yyyy-mm-dd` in order to trace the corresponding daily file.
