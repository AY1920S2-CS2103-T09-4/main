== Introduction

FitHelper (FH) is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing contacts*. More importantly, FH is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, FH can get your weight management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

FitHelper mainly serves as a fitness log book where users can *mark down their diet and exercises entries* and *be reminded about their plans*. They can also *visualize their performance* to be encouraged.


== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `FitHelper.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Fitness Helper.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

functions with correct format of input. A link to the User Guide
is also provided after the list. The user can also go to the Help page by
clicking the **Help** button on the left hand side of the application.
Note that once the user types `help` or click the **Help** button,
the url of the User Guide is copied to the clipboard, so the user

Format: `help`

=== Adding an entry: `add`

Adds an entry to the fitness log book. The entry added will be displayed in DashBoard, Calendar
and possibly Today Page (if its date is today) immediately after the command is executed.

first 14 characters of its name and first 21 characters of its location. The entry icon in
Calendar Page are even more constrained.

Format: `addX n/NAME t/DATETIME l/LOCATION c/CALORIE es/False dr/DURATION r/REMARK...`

[TIP]
An entry in the log book can have any number of remarks (including 0)

Examples:

* `adds n/running t/Wednesday 6 pm l/utown gym c/500kcal es/True r/relly fun`

* `diary` switches to the `Diary Page` where all diary logs are displayed in chronological order

==== Add a new diary

* `addDiary d/DATE dc/DIARYCONTENT` +

If there is previously added diary on the specified `DATE`, calling `addDiary` will rewrite the content.

Examples:

* `addDiary d/2020-03-31 dc/Happy birthday Alice!`
Adds a diary log on the date `2020-03-31` with the content `Happy birthday Alice!`.

==== Append new content to an existing diary

appends new content to the existing diary on the specified `DATE`. +

If the specified `DATE` does not have previously added diary log, this command will be discarded with a `DIARY_NOT_FOUND`
reminder.

Examples:

* `appendDiary d/2020-03-31 dc/You are one year older now:)` (after `addDiary d/2020-03-31 dc/Happy birthday Alice!`)+
This command appends the new diary content to the existing the diary log on the date `2020-03-31`.

****
* The field `DATE` has higher priority than `KEYWORDS` in the search.
i.e. If the `DATE` field is non-empty, regardless of the presence and the content of the `KEYWORDS` field,
the diary under that date will be displayed. If the specified `DATE` contains no previous diary logs,
no diary will be listed.
* If the field `DATE` is left empty, only the `KEYWORDS` field is considered in the search,

* The updated attribute name is *not* case-sensitive and can include spaces, but the name must match some fields in user profile.
* e.g. Both `attr/target weight` and `attr/TARGETWEIGHT` are acceptable.

- If current weight is *larger* than target, the gap between the two will be highlighted.
- If current weight is *the same or less* than the target, a succeed notification will be generated.

* *Trend Graph - Weight* +
Display a trend graph of user's weight according to time.

* *Trend Graph - BMI* +
Display a trend graph of user's BMI according to time. The BMI value is calculated by weight and height value at that date.

=== Add Weight Records : `addWeight`

Add a new weight record into the weight records database. A weight record is related to date and weight value, and a auto-computed BMI value will be stored as well. +
Every `addWeight` command will lead to the weight page. If the new weight record is added successfully, explicit changes of new points in the two trend graph can be found. +

Format: `addWeight v/WEIGHT_VALUE [d/DATE]`

****
* If no weight record exists in the database, "Not Available Now" will be shown in profile page's Current Weight and Current BMI fields.
* The date of the new weighe record can be *omitted*. By default, it will refer to the date of today.
* The date should be in format of `yyyy-MM-dd`.
* *No two weight records should have the same date.* If adding a weight record with the same date as an existing weight, a warning will be generated, and thus fail to add.

* *FitHelper Feedback* +
Based on the user's intake food calorie and sport task completion, FitHelper provides suggestions and reminders
in the `FitHelper Feedback` area.

==== [proposed] Some Day Page

The `Today Page` for some day in the history can be displayed.
Format: `today DATE`

[TIP]
The `DATE` should be equal or prior to `today`. Requiring a `Today Page` for a future #date# will generate a blank page if that particular day does not have any entries.

Examples:

* `today`
* `today 2020-02-14`

=== [proposed] Weekly Report

A weekly report serves as a summary for the past week. The user can see his performance in the past week. The weekly report also contains his rewarding points, diary logs, and preferred sports and food from the previous week. +

Format: `weekreport DATE` where `DATE` specifies the week it is in

[TIP]
The `DATE` should be equal or prior to days in the current week. Requiring a `Week Report` for a future week will generate a blank page if that particular day does not have any entries.

Examples:

* `weekreport`
* `weekreport 2020-02-14`

=== Sort food/sports entry list

Sorts food or sports entry list, or both of them, based on starting time or
calorie value of the entry, in either ascending or descending order.
The user must specify the sorting criterion `cal/c OR time/t`.
If the user does not specify type of entry list, both lists will be sorted.
And if the user does not specify the sorting order `a OR d`,
the default order is descending (i.e. entry that starts later
or entry with higher calorie value comes first).

format: `sort [x/TYPE] by/SORT_BY [o/ORDER]`

Examples:

* `sort x/f by/time o/a` (sort food entry list in ascending order of recording time, i.e. the older entry comes first)
* `sort by/c` (sort both food and sports entry list in descending order of calorie value
i.e. entry with higher calorie intake/consumption comes first)

=== Check calorie intake/consumption of common food/sports

Searches through the pre-set database for calorie intake/consumption information
about food/sports whose name match/contain keywords specified by the user.
Note that due to space constraint, at most 3 matching results will be shown
at the left-bottom corner of the application. Each result contains the name of
the food/sports and its calorie intake/consumption information: for food, it will be
in cal per serving (weight per serving in g will also be listed); for spots, it will
be in cal per hour. The searching works as follows:

* Retrieve calorie data of food/sports based on check type specified by the user.
* First, check if there are food/sports whose name **equals** one of the keywords.
If so, add them to the result list. Stop checking when 3 matching results are found or
when all food/sports are checked.
* Secondly, if fewer than 3 food/sports are added so far, check if there are food/sports
whose name **contains** the keywords as a whole. If so, add them to the result list.
Stop checking when 3 matching results are found so far or when all food/sports are checked.
* Lastly, if still fewer than 3 food/sports are added so far, check if there are food/sports
whose name **contains** the keywords as a whole. If so, add them to the result list.
Stop checking when 3 matching results are found so far or when all food/sports are checked.
* If no matching result is found after all the steps, feedback user search failure.
Otherwise, show feedback user matching results.


format: `check x/TYPE k/ONE_OR_MOR_ KEYWORDS`

Examples:

* `check x/food k/apple` (searches for calorie intake of food
whose name match/contain keyword "apple")
