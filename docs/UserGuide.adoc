== Introduction

FitHelper (FH) is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing contacts*. More importantly, FH is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, FH can get your weight management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

FitHelper mainly serves as a fitness log book where users can *mark down their diet and exercises entries* and *be reminded about their plans*. They can also *visualize their performance* to be encouraged.
