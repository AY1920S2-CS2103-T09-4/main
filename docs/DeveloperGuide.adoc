== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `FitHelperParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `fithelper.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::today[]
=== Today Feature

==== Implementation

FitHelper's entries have a `Time` attribute including a `Date` and a specific `Time` in the format of `yyyy-mm-dd HH:mm`.
This feature allows the user to view entries with the `Date` of today, i.e. shows only entries in today.
It fetches the `filteredFoodEntryList` and `FilteredSportsEntryList` stored in FitHelper storage.

The today mechanism is facilitated by
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/collections/transformation/FilteredList.html[FilteredList]
which wraps a ObservableList and
filters using the provided Predicate.
A `FilteredList<Entry> filteredEntries` is stored in the `ModelManager`.
In `FitHelper`, there is an
`ObservableList<Entry> entries` which contains all entries, regardless of its `Type` and `Date`. `filteredEntries`
in the ModelManager is initialized with this ObservableList.

Since a FilteredList needs a Predicate, which matches the elements in the source list that should be visible, the filter mechanism implements the following operation to support filtering:

* `Model#updateFilteredEntryList(Predicate<Entry> predicate)` -- Sets the value of the property Predicate in the `filteredEntries`.

** Predicates are declared statically in the `Model` interface, namely
`PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_ENTRIES`, `PREDICATE_SHOW_UNDONE_ENTRIES`, and `PREDICATE_SHOW_TODAY_ENTRIES`.
In particular `PREDICATE_SHOW_TODAY_ENTRIES` is as follows
```java
    Predicate<Entry> PREDICATE_SHOW_TODAY_ENTRIES = entry ->
            entry.getTime().getDateStr().equals(new Today().getTodayDateStr());
```

** The `TodayCommand` will call this method to change the visibility of entries with different status by passing in the corresponding predicate.

An example usage scenario and how the today mechanism behaves at each step is shown below.

**Step 1.** The user launches the application for the first time.
`UniqueEntryList` will be initialized with a list of default entries in FitHelper.
This list contains a few entries with various dates.

**Step 2.** The user inputs `today` to list all today entries. `UI` passes the input to `Logic`.
Logic then uses a few `Parser` classes to extract layers of information out as seen from steps 3 to 5.

**Step 3.** Logic passes the user input to `FitHelperParser`. `FitHelperParser` identifies that this is a `TodayCommand`
through the word "today".
It then creates a
`TodayCommandParser` to parse the it into a `TodayCommand` and return.

**Step 4.** `Logic` finally gets the `TodayCommand` and execute it.
The execution firstly calls
`Model#updateFilteredEntryList(Predicate<Entry> predicate)` to update the Predicate in
`filteredEntries` in `Model`.
This execution then returns a `CommandResult` to `UI`, containing the response to the user.

**Step 5.** `UI` displays the response in the `CommandResult`.
In addition, UI will change to display today entries after model updates `filteredEntries`, since `UI` is constantly listening for the change in `Model`.

The Sequence Diagram below shows how the components interact with each other for the above mentioned scenario.

.Sequence Diagram for Today Feature
image::TodaySequenceDiagram.png[]


// tag::diary[]
=== Diary Feature

==== Implementation

FitHelper also allows the user to keep a diary with a `Date` in the format of `yyyy-mm-dd` and the `content` with no more than 200 characters.
The diaries are represented as model `Diary` with the attributes of `DiaryId`, `DiaryDate`, and `Content`.
This feature allows the user to view their diaries.
It fetches the `filteredDiaryList` stored in FitHelper storage.

The diary feature is facilitated by
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/collections/transformation/FilteredList.html[FilteredList]
which wraps a ObservableList and
filters using the provided Predicate.
A `FilteredList<Diary> filteredDiaries` is stored in the `ModelManager`.
In `FitHelper`, there is an
`ObservableList<Diary> diaries` which contains all diaries, regardless of its `DiaryDate`. `filteredDiaries`
in the ModelManager is initialized with this ObservableList.

Since a FilteredList needs a Predicate, which matches the elements in the source list that should be visible, the filter mechanism implements the following operation to support filtering:

* `Model#updateFilteredDiaryList(Predicate<Diary> predicate)` -- Sets the value of the property Predicate in the `filteredDiaries`.

** The predicate is declared statically in the `Model` interface, namely
`PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_DIARIES`.
In particular `PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_DIARIES` is as follows
```java
    Predicate<Diary> PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_DIARIES = unused -> true;
```

** The `DiaryCommand` will call this method to change the visibility of diaries with different status by passing in the corresponding predicate.

An example usage scenario and how the diary mechanism behaves at each step is shown below.

**Step 1.** The user launches the application for the first time.
`UniqueDiaryList` contains no default diaries before the user adds any.

**Step 2.** The user inputs `diary` to list all diaries. `UI` passes the input to `Logic`.
Logic then uses a few `Parser` classes to extract layers of information out as seen from steps 3 to 5.

**Step 3.** Logic passes the user input to `FitHelperParser`. `FitHelperParser` identifies that this is a `DiaryCommand`
through the word "diary".
It then creates a
`DiaryCommandParser` to parse the it into a `DiaryCommand` and return.

**Step 4.** `Logic` finally gets the `DiaryCommand` and execute it.
The execution firstly calls
`Model#updateFilteredDiaryList(Predicate<Diary> predicate)` to update the Predicate in
`filteredDiaries` in `Model`.
This execution then returns a `CommandResult` to `UI`, containing the response to the user.

**Step 5.** `UI` displays the response in the `CommandResult`.
In addition, UI will change to display diaries after model updates `filteredDiaries`, since `UI` is constantly listening for the change in `Model`.

The Sequence Diagram below shows how the components interact with each other for the above mentioned scenario.

.Sequence Diagram for Diary Feature
image::DiarySequenceDiagram.png[]

// tag::calendar[]
=== Calendar
. The user enters a view command in the `calendar d/tmr`.

. `LogicManager` parses the user input, constructs and executes the `CalendarCommand`.

. The `CalendarCommand` reaches `setCalendarDate` in the `Model` and returns the `CommandResult` to the `LogicManager`.

. The `LogicManager` returns the `CommandResult` to the `Ui`.

. The `Ui` gets the `date` from `LogicManager` and updates the Ui to display the module.
The following sequence diagram shows how the update operation works to change calendar page in model:
image:CalendarSequenceDiagram.png[]
// end::calendar[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Add Weight Records

FitHelper allows the user to track with their weight change easily by allowing user to add their current weight and previous weight.

==== Sample
An example usage scenario and how the `addWeight` command behaves at each step is shown below.

**Step 1.**

* The user launches the application for the first time.
* `UniqueWeightList` in Model contains no default weights before the user adds any.
* `weightrecords.json` in local Storage contains no weight records as well.

**Step 2.**

* The user inputs `addWeight` command word, followed by `v/WEIGHT_VALUE` and an optional `d/DATE`.
* `UI` passes the input to `Logic`.
* `Logic` then uses a few `Parser` classes to extract layers of information out as seen from steps 3 to 5.

**Step 3.**

* `Logic` passes the user input to `FitHelperParser`.
* `FitHelperParser` identifies that this is a `AddWeightCommand` through the command word "addWeight".
* It then creates a `AddWeightCommandParser` to parse the input into a `AddWeightCommand` and return back.

**Step 4.**

* `Logic` gets the `AddWeightCommand` and execute it.
* The execution firstly check is the new weight date is after today's date and if there is already a existing weight in the UniqueList.
* Both of these two cases will throw corresponding `CommandException`.
* Then the execution add the new `Weight` into model.
* Finally, it returns a `CommandResult` to `UI`, containing the response to the user and the displayPage, which equals to `WEIGHT` page.

**Step 5.**

* `UI` displays the response in the `CommandResult`.
* In addition, UI will change to display Weight Page after updating Profile Page and Weight Page.

==== Implementation

===== Storage

A weight is stored with three attributes in the `weightrecords.json` database:

* `date` : the date of the weight record in format of `yyyy-MM-dd`, if no date is provided by the user, the *default value* is the date of today
* `weightValue` : a double value with two decimal places.
* `bmi` : the BMI value is also a double value with two decimal places.
It is auto-computed and stored, using the formula : `BMI = Weight Value(kg) / Height(m)^2`.
The Height value gets from user profile in `userprofile.json` database.

===== Model

* A single weight is represented as model `Weight` with the attributes of `Date`, `WeightValue`, and `Bmi`. +

* In `ModelManager`, all weights are represented by `WeightRecords weightRecords`.
** The `WeightRecords` class implements `ReadOnlyWeightRecords` interface, and therefore can return an *unmodifiable* version of a *unique* list of weights.
** The `WeightRecords` wraps a `UniqueWeightList` which allows adding and iterating. *Unique* here refers to the constraint that no two weight with the same date can exist in the list/database.

* In `ModelManager`, a `FilteredList<Weight> filteredWeight` object is used to store and update a filtered version of all weights.
** The
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/collections/transformation/FilteredList.html[FilteredList]
wraps a `ObservableList` and filters using a provided `Predicate`. +

===== UI
When user input `addWeight` command to `UI`, the input is passed to `Logic` part as a `String`.

After `addWeight` command is executed, a `CommandResult` with `DisplayPage` equals `WEIGHT` will be passed back to `MainWindow` in `UI` part. Then:

* Firstly, it will call `updateProfilePage()`, since if the newly added weight has the lasted date, Current Weight and Current BMI in uer profile will need to be updated.
* Secondly, it will call `updateWeightPage()`, since if a new weight is added successfully, new points should be added on to Weight Line Chart and BMI Line Chart.
The text content of top notification will also be updated if the gap between Current Weight and Target Weight is changed.
* Lastly, it will call `showWeightPage()`. This allows the Main Window auto-switch to Weight Page after each `addWeight` command by user.

===== Logic

The Sequence Diagram below shows how the components interact with each other for the mentioned scenario in sample.

.Sequence Diagram for Add Weight Feature
image:AddWeightSequenceDiagram.png[]

=== Check calorie intake/consumption of some common food/sports

==== Implementation
The check function is achieved by calling the `FitHelper` inside the `ModelManager` to search
through either `FoodCalorieTable` or `SportsCalorieTable` for `CalorieEntry` that contain the
keywords specified by the user.

Given below are example usage scenario:

Initialization: when the application is launched, `ModelManager` will initialize a `FitHelper`, which
will in turn initialize both `FoodCalorieTable` and `SportsCalorieTable` to contain pre-set data
which is a list of one type of `CalorieEntry` (either `FoodCalorieEntry` or `SportsCalorieEntry`).

image::InitializationOfCalorieTables.png[test, 50%]

Case 1: when the user enter the command `check x/sports k/swim`, the `LogicManager` will create
a `CheckCommand`, which askes `ModelManager` to let `FitHelper` to search through `SportsCalorieTable`
to add first 3 `CalorieEntry` whose name contains the keyword `swim` into a List, and return the
list to `CheckCommand`. Since the list contains at least one `CalorieEntry` (meaning there is
some matching entries), the `CheckCommand` returns a `CommandResult` whose `feedbackToUser`
contains a success message followed by the string representation of each matching entries.

Case 2: when the user enter the command `check x/f k/swim`, the `LogicManager` will create
a `CheckCommand`, which askes `ModelManager` to let ` FitHelper` to search through `FoodCalorieTable`
to add first 3 `CalorieEntry`s whose name contains the keyword `swim` into a List, and return
the list to `CheckCommand`. Since the list contains no `CalorieEntry` (meaning there is no
matching entries), the `CheckCommand` returns a `CommandResult` whose `feedbackToUser` contains
a failure message followed by the string representation of the keyword.

image::SequenceDiagramForCheckCommand.png[test, 150%]

==== Design Considerations

Aspect: Data structure to store entries

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use an `ArrayList` as an attribute in CalorieTable
to store the entries.
** pros: easy to implement partial-key search (compare the keyword with the name of each entry in the list).
** cons: O(n) complexity for finding matching entries, where n is the number of entries in the list.
* **Alternative 2:** Use a `HashMap` as an attribute in CalorieTable to store the entries.
The key is the name of the entry and the value is the entry.
** pros: (theoretically) O(1) time complexity for finding an entry given a complete keyword,
regardless of how many entries are in the HashMap.
** cons: hard to implement partial-key search (i.e. the keyword is only part of the name of the entry).

=== Adding A New Weight Record

. Add *first weight record* while there is no previous weight record in the database.

.. Prerequisites: None. Users are able to use `addWeight` command at any page.
.. Test case: `addWeight v/50.0` +
   Expected:
- A new `Weight` is added into `weightrecords` database, with `WeightValue` equals 50.0, `Date` with default value(today's date) and `BMI` calculated by `Height`.
- The window is automatically directed to weight page. A new point is shown on both Weight Line Graph and BMI Line Graph. The top notification is also updated.
- In profile page, Current Weight and Current BMI change from "Not Available Now" to the newest value.
.. Test case: `addWeight v/49.0 d/2050-01-01` +
   Expected: No new weight record is added since the date is after current date. An error message is shown in the command result box.

. Add new weight record when there is already *some previous weight records existing* in the database.
.. Prerequisites: None. Users are able to use `addWeight` command at any page.
.. Test case: `addWeight v/48.0` +
   Expected: No new weight record is added since there is existing weight record with the same date (by default is today's date) in the data base. An error message is shown in the command result box.
.. Test case : `addWeight v/47.0 d/2020-03-01` +
   Expected:
- A new `Weight` is added into `weightrecords` database, with `WeightValue` equals 47.0, `Date` with 2020-03-01 and `BMI` calculated by `Height`.
- The window is automatically directed to weight page. A new point is shown on both Weight Line Graph and BMI Line Graph, and form a new trend line with previous data points. The top notification is also updated.
- In profile page, Current Weight and Current BMI remain the same, since the newly added weight record is not the most recent record in the database.



=== Saving data

. Dealing with missing/corrupted data files

.. If the application is launched and shut down at least once, there will be three local database in json format.
.. Delete `fithelper.json`, and launch FitHelper again. All user manipulation on entries and diaries will be cleared. `Dashboard`, `Today`, `Calendar` and `Diary` Page will restart with sample data.
.. Delete `userprofile.json`, and launch FitHelper again. All user manipulation on user profile will be clear. `Profile` page will restart with sample user data.
.. Delete `weightrecords.json`, and launch FitHelper again. All user manipulation on weight records will be clear. `Profile` page will show Current Weight and Current BMI as "Not Available Now", and `Weight` Page will have no data point on the trend line graph.
